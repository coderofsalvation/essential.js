## Highlights

Essential.js is an alternative to [Underscore.js](http://underscorejs.org/) that gives you a solid base to get started with functional programming in JavaScript:

- All non-variadic functions with more than one argument are curried.
- Arguments are in proper order for better composition.
- Includes a few helpers not found in Underscore.
- Inspired by [Brian Lonsdorf's](https://github.com/DrBoolean) talk, [Hey Underscore, You're Doing it Wrong](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m3svKOdZijA).
